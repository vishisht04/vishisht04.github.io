I have made the contact form that is very easy to follow, and I have validated it using html and java script. I made it responsive using bootstrap, a free to use library, I have put the entire form in a class named container which makes it responsive. I have implemented code to let user input only alphabetical characters in the name box. In the email text box value that matches the email syntax mentioned as the placeholder is considered valid. In address any value but should not be empty, same in city box, you can choose a city from the list or write your own. The postal code should be a Canadian postal code which matches the regex mentioned in the input of html. Selecting a radio button is mandatory too which is implemented using js coding. On clicking the third radio button “Order Problem” a box appears asking for the order number from the user while clicking the other two radio buttons this box remains hidden. This is implemented using js too using the function orderNumber() which checks whether the checked button is the third button or not and if it’s the third button it changes the display style from none to block. Lastly, the big text box for the details related to the issue is added and is mandatory. I tested my page several times and came across a lot of bugs, I kept resolving each of them. In the process of resolving them, some new bugs came up and then I carefully resolved all of them. One of the major bug was designing the regex for postal code, I resolved it by trial and error method. The advise I would like to give to all those who are developing forms would be that they should keep surfing the net, keep looking at the different designs on websites keep looking for the exciting features and try to think how these big companies might have implemented it, seeing the source or inspect would help a lot. Using already developed libraries that are highly credible and are used for ages, is a great way to make a form too.
